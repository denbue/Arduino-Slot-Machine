# Simple Arduino Slot Machine

**The Button is back!** This time it is connected to a simple browser-based slot machine. 

## The hardware
### Step 1-6
Follow the instruction to build your own Arduino Staples button here: https://github.com/denbue/The-Real-90s-Button.

## The software

### Step 7
Connect the Arduino with your computer, the drivers will be automatically installed. Open with the Arduino software the file red_button_pulsing.ino (see red_button_pulsing folder) and upload it to the Arduino.

### Step 8

Open the index.html file and edit the list of the slot machine in your favourite editor. Finally, open the file in your browser of choice. To check if everything works press “x” on your keyboard or the button!

We used the slot machine on top of (another) interactive video installation. You are free to have do whatever you can from here. Share your projects and have fun!
